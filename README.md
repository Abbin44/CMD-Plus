## Wand Editor
The wand editor is the equivilent of the linux command touch. It allows you to open a file, edit it's contents and then either quit without saving, or quit and save. It also allows you to quickly peek at a file which simply prints the content, you cannot edit the text in this mode.

The wand editor also have syntax highlighting for better readability when modifying code. If you open a file that does not contain code, you can easily toggle off the coloring and read everything in plain text.
